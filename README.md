# FakeNewsDetection
Fake News Detection with Python using Natural Language Processing
.

## Introduction
  With the rise of the social media platform it is easier for anyone to access information in 
real time, However, there are also people who also use social media platforms in the negative 
way to attain monetary gain by spreading fake news. Fake news often has the aim of damaging 
the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. It is important 
that we have some mechanism for detecting fake news. The goal of this project is to create a 
model that will classify news into true and fake news.
Fake news is not rumors or just yellow journalism.  Fake news has its own definition. It's 
a completely fabricated claim or story created with an intention to deceive often for a secondary 
gain. The gain is usually financial or political. Fake news existed even during world war one and 
two. For example, there was a claim saying that Germany was extracting glycerin out of dead 
soldiers and used them to influence China to join the war. Fake news nowaday becomes a very 
serious problem due to social media platforms. They contain a huge amount of false claims 
created intentionally to manipulate public perception and mislead the readers. Despite the danger 
of fake news on social media it has been reported that over 62 percent of US adults are getting 
news from social media than other traditional news organizations.
The goal of this project is to create a model that inputs text and output whether the text is 
likely to be truthful or fake. All work is done on jupyter-lab.
